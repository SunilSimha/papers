## Introduction
This report is based on the seminars and colloquia held at the Department of Physics. I have found the following topics interesting and thus have compiled a brief report on the contents discussed in these talks.

* Multimessenger astrophysics: GW and EM observation of binary pulsar merger.
* Exploring the frontiers of flavour physics: A glimpse into the future of research at LHCb.

## Multimessenger astrophysics
This talk by Dr. Chandrakant Mishra was based on the paper by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations
